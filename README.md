# Monitoring the Age of Field Anopheles Mosquitoes Using MALDI-TOF and Deep Learning by Mohammad,Nabet et al.

This repository provides an overview of a method for estimating the age of field mosquitoes and modelling the age structure of the population. It is based on the article **"Predicting the age of field Anopheles mosquitoes using mass spectrometry and deep learning"** by Mohammad, Naudion et al. (https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adj6990) The repository includes Python codes, notebooks and the model architecture for regression prediction and other prediction methods applicable to any dataset.

For access to datasets or additional codes, please contact CÃ©cile Nabet (cecilenabet7@gmail.com) or Noshine Mohammad (noshine.mohammad@gmail.com).
